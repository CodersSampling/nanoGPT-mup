# Experiment Reproduction

Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We used the PyTorch NGC container for GPU-based runs, but any environment with the dependencies from [the main README](https://github.com/EleutherAI/nanoGPT-mup?tab=readme-ov-file#install) installed will suffice.
